Assembly code for PIC18F452

Project: Using a plexiglass body that will cary a battery, QwikFlash dev board that uses a PIC18F452 microcontroller, and has 2 wheels, attach ultrasonic proximity detectors and photodiodes so that you can coordinate the movement of the plexiglass body around the lab room, can detect infrared beacons of different frequencies, and can display how many beacons it has detected and the frequency of the beacon that has last been detected.
